# form-validate
This project is a simple registration form built using **JavaScript**. It collects basic user information like username, email, password, and confirmation of the password. Real-time validation ensures all fields are correctly filled before submission.

## Key Features
- **User-Friendly Design**: Responsive and modern interface.
- **Input Validation**: Ensures correct format for username, email, password, and confirmation.
- **Error Handling**: Displays error messages and highlights invalid fields.
- **Form Reset**: Alerts on successful submission and clears all fields.

## Technologies
- **HTML**: Structure and layout.
- **CSS**: Styling and responsiveness.
- **JavaScript**: Form validation, feedback, and handling of submission.

## How It Works
1. **Validation Logic**: JavaScript checks real-time input.
2. **Real-Time Feedback**: Invalid inputs are highlighted, and error messages are shown.
3. **Form Submission**: If valid, the form clears and a success message is shown.
